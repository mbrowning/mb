					<li><strong class="space-after">Increased Kohl’s logo size</strong>Removing the secondary horizontal nav and reducing the banner height allows for dramatically enlarging the Kohl’s logo, providing increased awareness of the brand.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Much more white space</strong>Renders the page easier on the eyes, and each element more findable. Made possible by getting rid of the horizontal nav that used to sit right underneath the logo and search box&mdash;all of its links <a class="see" href="kohls-nav.htm" rel="external">can be relocated elsewhere</a>.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Moved search box to right side of page</strong>Not only is this placement more conventional, the search box is no longer crowding the Kohl’s logo.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Increased prominence of global nav</strong>Extra space in the new layout allows for a bigger font in the global nav. In combination with the reduced banner height below, this makes it easier to see and use. </li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Reduced height of banner</strong>By refining each section of the banner to its core message, the global nav stands out more, <em>and</em> the banner's messages would come through more clearly.</li>
						<ul class="supporting-two">
							<li>For example: <em>Free Shipping / with $75 purchase / details</em></li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Vertical nav on left</strong>That's the conventional location, at least for audiences that mostly read (and scan web pages) left to right.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Nav further up the page</strong>Placing this nav in the expected spot, and <a class="see" href="kohls-vert-nav.htm" rel="external">giving it a clearer identity</a>, eliminates the need for a label (<em>More to Explore</em>). Now more of it is initially visible on smaller displays.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Simpler content area</strong>No duplicate content, and limit the number of promotions to avoid visual overload.</li>

					<li>Search box is crowding the logo; tagline is blending in with the horizontal nav directly below.</li>
					<li>Two horizontal nav bars stacked on top of each other creates uncertainty as to which is primary: the one with the larger font, or the one placed higher on the page?</li>
						<ul class="supporting-two">
							<li>This arrangement also makes for too many links in a small space; it is difficult to scan and keep track of all of the navigation options.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Of course, that the upper navigation bar has no theme precludes the possibility of it being logically related to other page elements.</li>
						<ul class="supporting-two">
							<li>The links from this navigation bar can more effectively be <a class="see" href="kohls-nav.htm" rel="external">integrated into other areas of the page</a>, and remain at least as visible to the user.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>The banner dwarfs the main navigation, and there’s too much info for a such a small space, contributing to the busy feel of the page. Too much detail is provided up front; the “details” link at the bottom of each section is all that is needed.</li>
					<li>Duplicate content, stacked right on top of each other.</li>
					<li>This nav is labeled <em>More to Explore</em> because otherwise users would probably wouldn't know what it is, due to its lack of a clear identity and odd placement.</li>
					<li>The categories in this nav don't begin until about a third of the way down the content area.</li>
