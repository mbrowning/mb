					<li><strong>Main Section</strong></li>
						<ul class="supporting-two">
							<li>With so many categories, the global nav is much easier to scan vertically. This also provides plenty of space to add a few new categories (net total of four added):</li>
							<li id="added"><em>Added</em></li>
								<ul class="nested-deep">
									<li>Crafts &amp; Hobbies</li>
									<li>Pharmacy</li>
									<li>Photo</li>
									<li>Office &amp; Paper</li>
									<li class="gray">Gift Cards</li>
									<li class="gray">Gift Certificates</li>
									<li class="gray">Memberships</li>
									<li class="gray">Tickets</li>
								</ul>
							<li id="removed"><em>Removed</em></li>
								<ul class="nested-deep-float-right">
									<li>Entertainment</li>
									<li>Office Products</li>
									<li>What's New (relocated)</li>
									<li>View All (relocated)</li>
								</ul>
							<li class="clear"><em>Crafts &amp; Hobbies</em> was previously under <em>Entertainment</em>, where it didn't really belong. <em>Photo</em> and <em>Pharmacy</em> were pulled from one of the deleted horizontal navs. All of these labels represent departments, so they belong in the global nav.</li>
							<li><em>Office Products</em> becomes <em>Office &amp; Paper</em>, so that <em>Invitations &amp; Announcements</em>, previously listed under <em>Entertainment</em>, can become one of its subcategories. People probably buy these items mostly from big office supply stores anyway, so this is a natural place to look.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="new-section"><strong>Auxiliary Section</strong></li>
					 	<ul class="supporting-two">
								<li>The remaining four added items (beginning with <em>Gift Cards</em>) don't represent departments, but there's no department to put them under&mdash;they were previously subcategories of <em>Entertainment</em>, which made little sense. So they go in the global nav, separate from the departmental links, and clustered together to signify their commonality. This also gives these categories top-level visibility on the home page, where before they were buried or completely excluded.</li>
								<li>Each of these links goes to its own page, so the content currently crammed together on the <em>Entertainment - Tickets &amp; Gift Certificates</em> page can be indexed accurately and displayed attractively.</li>
								<li><em>Memberships</em> is the only completely new label. It was a necessary addition, as the many memberships on offer don't fit anywhere else.</li>
								<li>All the subcategories that were listed under <em>Entertainment</em> have now been accounted for, except for <em>Video Games</em>. But it already appears under <em>Electronics</em>, which is a more conventional parent category anyway.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="new-section"><strong>Supplemental Nav</strong></li>
						<ul class="supporting-two">
								<li>Finally, <em>What's New</em> and <em>View All</em> appear directly above the global nav, which highlights their relation to, and distinction from, the global nav's "departmental" categories. This also increases their visibility.</li>

						<ul class="supporting-two">
							<li><em>Entertainment</em> doesn't accurately describe its contents:</li>
								<ul class="nested-deep">
									<li>Crafts &amp; Hobbies</li>
									<li>Invitations &amp; Announcements</li>
									<li>Photo Center</li>
									<li>Tickets &amp; Gift Certificates</li>

						<ul class="supporting">
							<li class="clear"><em>Invitations &amp; Announcements</em>, <em>Photo Center</em>, <em>Gift Certificates</em>, and even <em>Crafts &amp; Hobbies</em> don't really qualify as "entertainment."</li>
							<li>Nor do the gift cards and membership offers listed on the <em>Tickets &amp; Gift Certificates</em> page, and as they're not linked in the global nav (or anywhere else), users may never know they exist.</li>
								<li>The <em>Tickets &amp; Gift Certificates</em> page also has way too many types of content, which renders its page title meaningless and its content a jumbled mess.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="new-section"><strong>What's New &amp; View All</strong></li>
						<ul class="supporting-two">
							<li>Every category in the global nav represents a department (<em>Furniture</em>, <em>Computers</em>, <em>Hardware</em>) except for <em>What's New</em> and <em>View All</em>. These are actually supplementary navigation options, so they shouldn't be presented as on the same level as the departmental categories.</li>
