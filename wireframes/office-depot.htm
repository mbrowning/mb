					<li><strong class="space-after">Logo to flush left</strong>It didn’t look bad a little to the right, but a clean left edge could enhance the design.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Global nav moved up the page</strong>Made possible by relocating the two links that used to be directly below the shopping cart.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Order Tracking now in Account/Service row</strong>This is (logically) where it belongs. </li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Reduced height of shopping cart</strong>Omitting its extraneous elements, along with tightening up the fonts and its graphic, allow for a more streamlined cart.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Conventional login</strong>The new cart leaves space to slide the phone number down, freeing up the conventional login spot in the top right corner.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Nixed background from banner</strong>Provides visual relief by creating some white space. Any graphics should not clash with the content area below.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after"> Vertical global nav</strong>The product columns that were under the main content area are gone, replaced by a vertical expand/collapse nav. A more efficient solution, in terms of screen space <em>and</em> ease of use.</li>
					<li><strong id="space-after">Ink Depot section further up the page</strong> As the top section of the new vertical nav, it stays permanently open and ready for use, as it was in the old design.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Expand/collapse</strong>The categories expand when clicked to show second-level nav options.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">New promo areas &amp; more white space</strong>No product columns means room for more content, and thick rows of white space help keep this area from looking cluttered. Graphically refining these sections, and removing their backgrounds, would also help.</li>

					<li>Way too much going on in this shopping cart. The little arrows next to the links at the bottom aren't instructive, so they amount to visual clutter. The "free delivery" copy doesn't belong here, especially since it’s repeated to the left above the search bar. And the fonts and cart graphic are bulky.</li>
					<li>With the login/register link surrounded on all sides, will anyone ever see it?</li>
					<li>This is an out-of-place customer service link; it adds to the clutter of this section.</li>
					<li>The banner and main content sections right on top of each other make this area of the page too dense; there is no obvious focal point. Both are graphics-heavy and use the same bold font. In this particular banner, the retail packaging for QuickBooks could be cut.</li>
					<li>The main content area rotates too quickly. It's on a five-second delay; seven would be less jarring.</li>
					<li>This nav has no theme, an image of an employee which suggests live chat but instead leads to an ad, and unusable, contradictory sub-sections. All of its content could be better placed in other areas.</li>
					<li>In particular, <em>Shopping Tools</em> contains links to OD-branded products, an A-Z product listing, and “Worklife Rewards”, which is not described anywhere on the page&mdash;there’s a lack of a theme even inside this one section. Also, OD-branded products should be given much more prominent placement.</li>
					<li>These product columns underneath the main content area are a waste of space and an awkward way to display subcategories.</li>
					<li>Too many heavy fonts and graphics in these promo areas; they more or less cancel each other out.</li>
