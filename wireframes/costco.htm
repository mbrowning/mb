					<li><strong class="space-after">Wider layout</strong>New layout is considerably wider to better accommodate the large volume of content.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Vertical global nav</strong>With so many categories, <a class="see" href="costco-nav.htm" rel="external">the global product nav</a> is much easier to scan vertically.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Separate supplemental nav links</strong><em>What's New</em> and <em>View All</em> appear directly above the global nav, which highlights their relation to, and distinction from, the global nav's "departmental" categories. This also increases their visibility.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Bigger logo</strong>A wider layout and more efficient organization allows for a bigger logo area.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Unified, distinct site shopping nav</strong>Their extra height distinguishes these <a class="see" href="costco-sup-nav.htm" rel="external">shopping nav</a> options from the <a class="see" href="costco-sup-nav.htm" rel="external">service nav</a> directly above.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Streamlined Costco Warehouse link</strong>Pruning unnecessary text makes this link smaller and its message easier to grasp.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Logically located Costco Info link</strong>It's at the top of the page where users expect it to be, right next to closely related links.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Conventional login</strong>Top-right login rules the day.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">More visible cart, smaller country option</strong>Cart link is bigger and has its own box for more visibility. Country drop-down box is no longer wasting space.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">Better email signup</strong>Copy is more enticing, the elements are arranged more efficiently, and it's much higher up on the page.</li>
					<li><strong class="space-after">More space between sections</strong>Keeps the page from looking crowded.</li>

				<ol>
					<li>Layout is barely 800 pixels wide, which is much narrower than most sites, and absurd for a big box retailer like Costco. The plethora of content has to be squished together for it all to fit.</li>
					<li>Two horizontal nav rows, each with an unclear identity, are stacked on top of one another. Visually disorienting and conceptually puzzling.</li>
					<li>Global nav is double-stacked, which is almost always a bad sign. Too many categories for effective horizontal viewing.</li>
					<li>Login is wedged between the global nav and search in an unconventional spot. Some users may never notice it here.</li>
					<li>All caps and too much text makes this link hard to look at. Glancing over it, you see "CLICK HERE" and a big jumble of words; it looks like a banner ad, so the "ignore" impulse instantly kicks in.</li>
					<li>This is way too far down the page for an "info" link, especially since it's sandwiched between ads and content. The bold font helps somewhat, but the overall approach is counterintuitive.</li>
					<li>Too many disparate, graphics-heavy promo sections packed together too tightly.</li>
